## 🎯 The Problem

Most bedbug treatment failures aren't product failures—they're **timing failures**.

- Housekeeping vacuums during critical 14-day spore establishment windows
- Follow-up inspections get missed at 21-day biological deadlines  
- Adjacent unit spread goes undetected until it's a 5-room outbreak

**Average cost of one failed treatment:** $3,500 (retreatment + vacancy + resident issues)

## 💡 The Solution

Bedbug Command Center automates what property managers try to track manually:

### Core Features

- **🧹 Daily Housekeeping Protocols** - Automatic "skip these rooms" lists prevent accidental spore removal
- **⏰ Biological Window Tracking** - Never miss critical 14-day, 21-day, or 35-day deadlines
- **🗺️ Visual Spread Detection** - Interactive heatmaps show cluster patterns before they multiply
- **📊 Treatment Documentation** - Audit-ready reports prove proper procedures were followed
- **🎯 Smart Prioritization** - Psychology-informed scoring focuses resources where they matter most

### Built For

- 🏢 Property Managers (multi-family, senior living, hospitality)
- 🐛 Pest Control Operators (professional coordination tools)
- 🏗️ Facilities Directors (large campus coordination)

## 🔬 Biology-Driven Intelligence

Built around **Beauveria bassiana** fungal treatment protocols:

- **Day 0-14:** Spore establishment protection (no-vacuum zones)
- **Day 21:** Critical assessment window (egg hatch timing)  
- **Day 35:** Follow-up verification (prevent rebound)
- **Adjacent units:** Proactive containment inspections

Based on peer-reviewed research:
- Principato & DeVries (2024) - *Journal of Economic Entomology*
- Aak, Hage & Rukke (2023) - *Pest Management Science*
- Barbarin et al. (2012) - *Journal of Invertebrate Pathology*
